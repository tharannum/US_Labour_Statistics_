# Project Documentation: US Labor Market & Wage Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview
**Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to analyze labor market trends across the United States to assist stakeholders in understanding wage disparities and employment density across various industries.

**Business Problem:** Raw labor data is often vast and disjointed, making it difficult for decision-makers to identify which industries are growing, which states are employment hubs, and how wages correlate with workforce size. This project solves that problem by transforming raw datasets into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that allows for instant comparative analysis.

## 2. Data Description
The analysis was performed using a structured dataset containing historical labor statistics.

* **Time Period:** 2017 – 2020
* **Geographical Scope:** United States (State-level data)
* **Key Categories:**
    * **Industry:** (e.g., Information, Business Services, Manufacturing, Hospitality, Construction, etc.)
    * **Metrics:** Average Annual Wage, Total Employees, Number of Establishments.

## 3. Analysis Performed
The raw data was processed and analyzed using advanced Excel functions to prepare it for visualization.

* **Data Cleaning:** Standardized state names and industry categories to ensure consistency across the dataset.
* **Pivot Tables:** Created intermediate tables to aggregate data, calculating:
    * Average Wage by Industry.
    * Total Employee count per State.
    * Year-over-Year (YoY) wage growth trends.
* **Dashboard Logic:**
    * Connected **Slicers** to multiple Pivot Charts to allow users to filter the entire report by specific Industries.
    * Implemented **Map Charts** to visualize the geographical concentration of wages and employment density (Employees per 1,000).

## 4. Key Business Questions
This analysis was designed to answer the following strategic questions:

1.  **Geographical Hubs:** Which US states are the primary hubs for specific industries (e.g., Where is the tech sector most concentrated)?
2.  **Wage Benchmarking:** How do average wages compare between high-volume industries (like Business Services) versus niche industries (like Information)?
3.  **Workforce Distribution:** What percentage of the total workforce is occupied by each major industry?
4.  **Growth Trends:** Are wages stagnating or growing in key sectors over the 4-year period?

## 5. Insights & Interpretation
By interacting with the dashboard, several key insights were revealed:

### **A. The High-Wage vs. High-Volume Trade-off**
* **Information Sector:** This sector pays the highest average wages (peaking over **$94k**). However, it accounts for a very small "Share of Total Employees" (**~4%**). The map visualization shows a strong concentration in coastal tech hubs (Washington, California).
* **Business Services:** This is the dominant employer, holding **29%** of the total workforce share, with moderate wages (~$75k).

### **B. Vulnerable Sectors**
* **Leisure & Hospitality:** Despite employing a large portion of the workforce (**19%**), this industry has the lowest average wages (approx. **$23k**). This indicates a high-volume, low-margin labor market.

### **C. Trend Analysis**
* Across almost all industries (Manufacturing, Health, Finance), there is a consistent upward trend in Average Wages from 2017 to 2020, indicating a competitive labor market even prior to recent economic shifts.

## 6. Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following actions are recommended:

* **For Talent Acquisition:** Recruiters looking for specialized, high-cost talent should focus their efforts on specific states (WA, CA, NY) where the "Information" and "Finance" densities are highest.
* **For Business Expansion:** Companies looking to open new massive operation centers (call centers, warehouses) should look at states with high "Business Services" density but lower average wage costs to optimize operational expenses.
* **For Policy/Retention:** The "Leisure & Hospitality" sector shows a significant wage gap compared to national averages. To reduce turnover, stakeholders in this industry may need to re-evaluate compensation packages to remain competitive against rising sectors like "Transportation."

## 7. Skills & Tools Used
This project demonstrates proficiency in the following technical areas:

* **Microsoft Excel:** Advanced formulas, XLOOKUP/VLOOKUP.
* **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Data aggregation and summarization.
* **Data Visualization:** Designing clean, readable Charts and Heat Maps.
* **Dashboard Design:** UI/UX principles (Slicers, layout, color consistency).
* **Data Cleaning:** Preparing raw data for analysis.

## 8. Outcome
The final output is a **fully interactive Executive Dashboard**.

Instead of scrolling through thousands of rows of spreadsheets, decision-makers can now click a single button (e.g., "Manufacturing") and immediately see:
1.  How much that industry pays.
2.  Where that industry is located.
3.  How that industry has performed over the last 4 years.

This reduces the "time-to-insight" from hours of manual reporting to mere seconds.
